/home/psrivastava/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: UserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("html.parser"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

The code that caused this warning is on line 389 of the file /home/psrivastava/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="html.parser"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.

  lis = BeautifulSoup(html).find_all('li')
